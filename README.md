## **BINGO Project**
This project is to test my python skills and to create something with the things I learned from school.
It is still a work in progress.
Currently this program could create a random BINGO card and can simulate a BINGO game.
<br />


<li>Things the I am still currently working to improve or develop are: 
    <ul>Improving this README file</ul>
    <ul>Way to make a custom BINGO Card taking from user input</ul>
    <ul>User interacting with BINGO game</ul>
    <ul>Create a Graphical Interface for the BINGO card</ul>
    <ul>Creating more and random patterns to win BINGO game</ul>
    <ul>Breaking some methods into smaller method (Make sure that a method only does one specific task)</ul>
    <ul>Decide a direction of where I want to take this BINGO project (detailed roadmap)</ul>
    <ul>Use LinkedList for predetermine numbers that are going to be called on the BINGO game</ul>
    <ul>Add specific issues on github and close ticket through gitbash</ul>
    <ul>Use branches and merge to do project progress</ul>
    <ul>Improve documentation of project (missing explanations, vague descriptions</ul>
</li>
